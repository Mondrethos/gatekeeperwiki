**Description:**

An Earthling who has now lived for over 700 years thanks to mechanical implants that have replaced almost all of his organs and body parts. His main endeavor has been to preserve the last organic part of himself, his brain. Techhunter has traveled most of the universe in search of the Creators with their virtually unlimited capabilities. But the Creators found him themselves.

Vita offered him the position of gatekeeper in the Temple of Time, in exchange for the immortality of his brain. Techhunter immediately agreed.
