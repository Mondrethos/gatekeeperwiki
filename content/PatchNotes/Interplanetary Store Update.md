# Interplanetary Store Update

Greetings, Gatekeepers!<br /><br />We are excited to announce the release of the first major update, which brings more depth to build creation, expands some existing mechanics, and adds many new features! <br /><br /><div class="bb_h3">List of the major changes:</div><br /><div class="bb_h1">Delta</div><br />After completing each location, <b>players will now be transported to Quiet Bay on the planet Delta</b>. In Quiet Bay, time stops, and <b>players can use the forge, buy artifacts from pedestals, assemble Triads</b>, and simply take a short break. <br />For each completed location, an additional pedestal will appear in Quiet Bay, increasing the selection of artifacts.  <br /><br />In future updates, the functionality of Quiet Bay will be expanded.<br /><br /><div class="bb_h1">Triads</div><br />Triads are <b>combinations of three artifacts</b> that, in some cases, enhance the effect of one artifact, and in other cases provide completely new effects.  <br /><br />Triads can be crafted in Quiet Bay at the Shrine of Triads.  <br /><br />Initially, there will be <b>15 types of Triads available</b>, but this list will grow in the future.  <br /><br />Here is the list of currently available Triads:  <br />1) <b>Triad of Scorch</b> - Each HVC bounce ignites the target.  <br />2) <b>Triad of Life </b>- Activating any interactive object increases Maximum Health by 10%. The accumulated effect resets upon appearing in the next location.  <br />3) <b>Triad of Carnage</b> - Skirmish projectile bounces off enemies up to 10 times.  <br />4) <b>Triad of Regeneration</b> - After Fractal activation, regeneration is doubled until Fractal is restored.  <br />5) <b>Triad of Shock</b> - Each hit on a stunned enemy causes an explosion.  <br />6) <b>Triad of Ember</b> - Protocol hits ignite enemies.  <br />7) <b>Triad of Calibration</b> - Critical hits reset 5% of the current skill cooldowns.  <br />8) <b>Triad of Assault </b>- Duo now flies alongside Buzz and Vanguard.  <br />9) <b>Triad of Cinderstorm</b> - Cinder Flare triggers at 75/50/25/0 percent of enemy's health.  <br />10) <b>Triad of Argument </b>- Increased Argument radius.  <br />11) <b>Triad of Reflection</b> - Karma is triggered by any hit on the gatekeeper.  <br />12) <b>Triad of Lumilore</b> - Meteorites hit enemies precisely if they are within the area of effect.  <br />13) <b>Triad of Devastation</b> - Delugeon triggers on the death of any enemy marked with the Bane Seal.  <br />14) <b>Triad of Tides</b> - Hollow Talisman now attacks with Rippletide.  <br />15) <b>Triad of Fireflow </b>- While Reflex is active, a trail of fire is left behind the gatekeeper.<br /><br /><div class="bb_h1">Chaos Wards</div><br /><b>A new objective</b> where players must destroy up to 4 Chaos Wards by activating and clearing their points.  <br /><b>Activating a Ward also triggers its effect.</b> Each Ward has its own effect.  <br /><br />Here is the list of current Ward effects:  <br />1) <b>Toxic Touch</b> - Ward imbues all enemies' attacks with poison essence.  <br />2) <b>Void Heal</b> - All enemies at the location gain strong health regeneration.  <br />3) <b>Veil of Mist</b> - Fog thickens at the location.  <br />4) <b>Detonation Shard </b>- Detonating shards remain from slain enemies.  <br />5) <b>Chrono Drift</b> - Clearing each Ward point slows down gatekeepers.  <br />6) <b>Repel Pulse</b> - Ward points push away gatekeepers.  <br />7) <b>Storm Rods</b> - Ward places storm rods throughout the location.  <br />8) <b>Caustic Pour</b> - Ward creates acid rain zones at the location.  <br />9) <b>Meteorium</b> - Ward summons a meteor shower.  <br />10) <b>Solar Flare</b> - Ward summons fire rays that chase gatekeepers.<br /><br /><div class="bb_h1">Teammate Resurrection </div> <br />Now, in co-op play, <b>players can revive a fallen teammate</b>.
