# The Nowhere Throne (Devblog #1)

<div class="bb_h2"><b>Greetings, Gatekeepers!</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph">We’re kicking off a brand new devblog series about the upcoming update for <b>Gatekeeper</b>,<br />titled <b>“The Nowhere Throne”</b> — aka version <b>1.0</b>.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">There’s a lot to talk about <i>(and we do mean a lot)</i>, but as tradition demands, we’re starting with what matters most — the<b> new Gatekeeper</b>.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2"><b>Aegis</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph">Aegis commanded the Order of the Delta Guardians — a force that covered the retreat of allied troops. On the day the Void Empire broke through the defenses, Lord Crustad cast him into a crystal well — the heart of an arcana mine.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Arcana did not let the body disappear. Shards grew through his armor, preserved the flesh, and dragged his mind into the Nowhere. There, the Creators offered him a place among the Gatekeepers. He accepted.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/42755050/41566e80d0e290dc109cce62bf766069b0473449.gif" /></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2"><b>Abilities</b></div><div class="bb_h3">Splinter</div><p class="bb_paragraph">Fires a crystal shard from one hand that pierces up to 3 enemies.</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Evo 1</b>: Each enemy pierced increases the shard's damage.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Evo 2</b>: The shard explodes on destruction, dealing AoE damage.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Evo 3</b>: Two extra shards spawn at the first hit location.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/42755050/2961271dac16da62f34804efca41865e1ebf0543.gif" /></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>A simple but brutally effective skill — especially against groups.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"> </p><div class="bb_h3">Deploy Glyphon</div><p class="bb_paragraph">Places a stationary Glyphon at a targeted location.<br />Only one can be active at a time — placing a new one replaces the old.</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Evo 1</b>: Max active Glyphons +1</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Evo 2</b>: Max active Glyphons +1</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Evo 3</b>: Glyphons gain access to Aegis’s artifacts.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/42755050/44bebdec3efd7d258002569547241704f0ef3eb2.gif" /></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Yes — Aegis can summon up to <b>three Glyphons</b>, and each one can use your artifacts. How cool is that?</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"> </p><div class="bb_h3">Spectra</div><p class="bb_paragraph">Leaves behind a Spectra and enters a phase state.<br />The state ends if you take any action other than movement, or when the timer runs out.<br />The Spectra vanishes once Aegis reappears.</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Evo 1</b>: Creates a pulling pulse at the activation point.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Evo 2</b>: Explodes when the Spectra is destroyed.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Evo 3</b>: Creates a weakening cloud on death.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/42755050/53df79751c90470b088aa92d68adae5eed641861.gif" /></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Low on HP? Drop a decoy, phase through enemies, and flank from the side.<br />Profit.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"> </p><div class="bb_h3">Ascension</div><p class="bb_paragraph">Activates Ascension for Aegis and all active Glyphons.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">While Ascended, Aegis fires from both hands with enhanced Splinters.<br />Consumes all available charges — increasing fire rate and shard size, but slowing Aegis down.</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Evo 1</b>: Kills replenish the Ascension meter.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Evo 2</b>: Shards pierce unlimited enemies.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Evo 3</b>: Each hand fires <b>two</b> shards at once.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/42755050/3304989b763a5df0d16cff914b8945c0cc48e95f.gif" /></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>This is, without exaggeration, <b>our most over-the-top ability yet</b>.<br />Press one button — turn the battlefield into a crater.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Link Field (Passive)</div><p class="bb_paragraph">Nice and simple — while Aegis stands near a Glyphon, it absorbs part of the damage he takes.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">I’ve played a lot with Aegis, and as of now — he’s my favorite Gatekeeper. His kit feels really fresh for Gatekeeper, and I think many of you will love the playstyle.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/42755050/79f484a7feb3faa8057126372e403749a5af87ab.gif" /></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Charging into a horde with 4 Ascension charges active, Glyphons blasting, shards flying —<br />yeah, it’s definitely a “<b>wow</b>” moment.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"> </p><p class="bb_paragraph">That’s all for today — but the next devblog is already cooking.<br />We’ll be diving into <b>tons of QoL improvements and balance changes</b>, so if brutal tweaks and spicy balance changes are your thing… stay tuned.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Next post drops in two weeks.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Until then...</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>See you in the Throne Room</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>— Gravity Lagoon </i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2">Socials</div><p class="bb_paragraph"><a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2Fgravitylagoon" rel=" noopener" target="_blank">Join our Discord</a></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><a class="bb_link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gatekeeper/" rel="" target="_blank">Join our Subreddit</a></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2Fgatekeeper_game" rel=" noopener" target="_blank">Follow on X</a></p>
