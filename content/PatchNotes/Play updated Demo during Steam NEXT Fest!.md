Guten tag, Gatekeepers!  
  
Today, we're excited to announce that Gatekeeper will participate in the upcoming Steam Next Fest (from Feb. 5 till Feb. 11)! Also, we'd like to introduce to you a completely new game mechanic - **in-game events**.

  

Steam NEXT Fest

  
The updated demo will feature various updates along with a brand new **Arena mode**!  
The mode consists of rounds of various duration and your only goal is to not get killed. When the timer ends and all the threats are eliminated, players receive rewards and proceed to another round. Sounds simple enough but don‚Äôt be tricked by that - the place is limited but the enemies amount is not. Read more about Arena in the [previous devglog](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2106670/view/3882730411608555780?l=english).

In addition to the Arena, the demo introduces a fresh lobby, an in-game multiplayer party search, an enhanced upgrade acquisition system, balance adjustments, and in-game events!  
  

In-Game Events

  
When a game event occurs, you'll receive a notification in the game log (there is a game log now ‚úçÔ∏è), alerting you to upcoming danger. Brace yourselves because these events are designed to test your skills and teamwork, pushing you to adapt on the fly.  
  
Currently, we have three distinct events ready to challenge you:  
  

Sia's Aggressive Souls

  
The restless souls of your enemies will chase you and your teammates. Be sure to keep your moving skills always ready.

Void Traps

  
Prepare to navigate through countless deadly traps that will do damage and slow you down. Be sure to always look in front of you.

Rampant Invasion

  
Instead of the usual foes, you'll face only rampants. Be sure to not die.

Combinations

  
But here's the kicker - these events can occur individually or in any combination, even all three simultaneously! Exciting!

We're continuously brainstorming and gathering ideas for more thrilling events to add to the mix. So, if you have any suggestions or ideas, don't hesitate to share them with us on our [Discord channel](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FHkrp6AUa5S).  
  
Thank you,  
Gravity Lagoon
