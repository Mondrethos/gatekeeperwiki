Greetings, Gatekeepers!  
  

THE NEW DEMO IS OUT! PLAY NOW!

The demo will be available during the Steam NEXT Fest, till Feb. 12, be sure not to miss it!

  

Demo Updates

  
The updated demo will feature various updates along with a brand new **Arena mode**!  
The mode consists of rounds of various duration and your only goal is to not get killed. When the timer ends and all the threats are eliminated, players receive rewards and proceed to another round. Sounds simple enough but donâ€™t be tricked by that - the place is limited but the enemies amount is not. Read more about Arena in the [previous devglog](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2106670/view/3882730411608555780?l=english).

In addition to the Arena, the demo introduces a fresh lobby, an in-game multiplayer party search, an enhanced upgrade acquisition system, balance adjustments, and in-game events! Read more about [in-games events](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2106670/view/4058374601080348605?l=english) in the previous update.
