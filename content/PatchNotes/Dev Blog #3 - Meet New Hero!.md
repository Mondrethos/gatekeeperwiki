Hello, Gatekeepers!  
  
As we approach the release (stay tuned for more news), we're excited to introduce our new upcoming character - Tech Hunter.  
Tech Hunter is swift, armed with a shotgun, and acquires new gear from defeated enemies! Learn more about his unique abilities:

The shotgun has a low rate of fire, but shoots over an area, and each pellet is a separate projectile.

A vacuum grenade is also in the arsenal. Throw the grenade to any visible distance. The vacuum first pulls all enemies within its radius towards it, then deals area damage.

Things may quickly go off a plan, so having an orbital strike from a satellite is a must. You can mark any enemy or location point, and after a brief delay, the marked area will be bombarded.

Following the previous point, Tech Hunter can immediately return to whatever place he marked previously, getting off the fight or quickly traversing to points of interest.

And finally, his passive ability allows you to extract artifacts directly from defeated enemies! Which, in my opinion, is pretty cool.  
  
Hope you will enjoy the character and find ways to overpower. Have a good one!  
  
  
Thank you,
