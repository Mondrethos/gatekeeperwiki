> Hey Gatekeepers,The wait is almost over — Gatekeeper launches in just 3 days, on August 1st!To celebrate, we’re kicking off a short series of posts highlighting some of the playable characters you’ll get to command on your mission to reclaim the Heart of Time.Let’s start with one of the most striking Gatekeepers in the lineup: Aegis Once the leader of the Delta Guardians, Aegis fell in battle during the Void Empire’s final push — only to be reborn through arcana-infused crystal deep in the mines of Nowhere. Now, he fights with the power of the Creators, armored in glass and vengeance.Aegis is a mid-range specialist with piercing crystal projectiles, a teleport-like phasing ability, and the unique power to deploy Glyphons — arcane constructs that help him dominate the battlefield. When upgraded, Aegis becomes a force of nature: launching massive volleys of splinters, unleashing battlefield-wide damage bursts, and linking up with his Glyphons in devastating synergy.He’s a slow-burning powerhouse — but when he activates his ultimate, Ascension, things go full chaos.Keep an eye out for more character spotlights in the coming days.Don’t forget to join the fight when Gatekeeper launches on August 1st!Thank you,Gravity LagoonSocialsJoin our DiscordJoin our SubredditFollow on X
