# Gatekeeper 1.0 launches on August 1, 2025!

<div class="bb_h2">Greetings, Gatekeepers!</div>Today we’re bringing you two big updates: a brand-new trailer, and — deep breath — the official release date!<br /><br /><div class="sharedFilePreviewYouTubeVideo sizeFull"><img class="sharedFilePreviewYouTubeVideo sizeFull" src="https://steamcommunity.com/public/shared/images/responsive/youtube_16x9_placeholder.gif" /></div><br />The 1.0 version is packed with new content — and we’ll be sharing the details step by step over the next couple of months.

He can deploy arcane turrets that copy his damage, shift into a ghostly form to avoid danger, and enter an enhanced state to unleash rapid dual attacks. Perfect for players who like methodical control, high burst damage, and battlefield dominance.<br /><br /><i>We’ll cover his abilities in more detail in a dedicated dev blog.</i><br /><br /><br /><div class="bb_h3">We’re also happy to announce that the Steam page has been updated!</div><br /><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/42755050/8678427d08bbe888cb8135572e09f0d7aedc5473.png" /><br />We’ve refreshed the main header image, added new screenshots, and replaced the old descriptions with updated text and GIFs.<br /><br />We hope you enjoyed the trailer and are just as hyped for <b>1.0</b> as we are :)<br /><i>(We may or may not have rewatched it a hundred times already)</i><br /><br />Stay tuned — we’ll be announcing beta testing for the release version very soon.<br />If you want early access, don’t miss it!<br /><br />See you in the <b>Throne Room</b>,<br />— <b>Gravity Lagoon</b><br /><br /><div class="bb_h2">Socials</div><a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2Fgravitylagoon" rel=" noopener" target="_blank">Join our Discord</a><br /><a class="bb_link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gatekeeper/" rel="" target="_blank">Join our Subreddit</a><br /><a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2Fgatekeeper_game" rel=" noopener" target="_blank">Follow on X</a>
