# Roadmap Update

Hello Gatekeepers!<br /><br />Due to the release of the Interplanetary Store Update, we’re updating the roadmap and making a few changes:<br /><br /><ul class="bb_ul"><li> The artifact ban has been moved to the next major update. We need more time to properly plan and integrate this system.<br /></li><li> Considering the number of changes in this update, we decided to postpone the creation of new artifacts to the next major update. The new artifacts will come together with new Triads.<br /></li><li> The “Pylons of Chaos” event from the second major update has been transformed into a new quest - “Chaos Ward” - and was released in the current update.<br /></li><li> The “Stylization of arenas to match all planets” point has been removed from the roadmap, as we decided to reallocate efforts toward new mechanics and content. Cosmetic changes are still planned but will be worked on in our free time.</li></ul> With the latest update, the game has grown larger and more complex, so we need more time to integrate new content and develop new systems. The update timelines have shifted slightly to ensure we deliver a higher-quality game.<br /><br /><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/42755050/53a13490afb069dec16ecd3e504fa15a7908a49c.png" /><br /><br />Thank you for your valuable feedback, which helps make the game better!<br /><br />Gravity Lagoon<br /><br />Join our community<br /><br /><a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FHkrp6AUa5S" rel=" noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/42755050/d0a560fa78423e2e3e18c3294e8b4553dac70eb9.png" /></a><br /><br /><a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fforms.gle%2FfcaySk59EmeZbfEq5" rel=" noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/42755050/bb2a549e5461d8d4ac4351f70461fbcc09c1b5f4.png" /></a><br /><br />What do you think of these changes?
