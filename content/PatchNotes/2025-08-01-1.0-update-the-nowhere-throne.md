Periodically strikes the ground with lightning around itself.Vesperal - Conceals all other enemies within a radius.Merchant's AltarA Merchant’s Altar has appeared in Quiet Bay.Initially, the Gatekeeper must restore the altar using Omni stones (progress is saved between runs).Once restored, the altar allows exchanging Omni stones for Prisms. The exchange rate matches current pedestal prices.New EventsPursuit by Immortals - Immortals appear in the location. One per Gatekeeper. Each Immortal hunts their specific Gatekeeper.Immortals have a permanent Immune status and can only be damaged with specific artifacts. Any hit from an Immortal is lethal.Opaline Shields - All enemies on the location have an Opaline Shield that must be broken before damaging their health.Omni-SuitsEach Gatekeeper now has an alternate skin.Unlock it by finding the corresponding statue and investing a large number of Omni stones.Achievements21 new Steam achievements have been added.Mechanics ChangesFractal now breaks on use.

Instead, the Injection artifact's cap has been increased to 100% (logarithmically).The Enhancer artifact now works for Void Model, reducing Entropy cost of the second skill (description is also updated accordingly).Elite, Event, and Siren SpawningIn Normal mode, up to 3 Sirens can now spawn from a single statue. Their count and elite status depend on difficulty level and run time.The same logic applies to events and elites. Early on, simple elites appear on lower difficulties, and no events spawn at all.Later in the run, elites get tougher and events start triggering more often, sometimes multiple at once.On 200% difficulty, this escalation begins much earlier.Quality of Life ChangesMax artifact ban slots increased to 10.Minimap icon added for Shrine of Triad.Artifact ban cost reduced from 5 to 3 Omni stones.Pressing Esc no longer closes the lobby screen (to prevent accidental exits).Random Gatekeeper selection added (available if you have more than 2 unlocked).Skill and evolution descriptions have been standardized to match artifact formatting.All skills now display their stats.UI for obelisks, the forge, and artifact popups has been updated for better readability.Astral Elite projectiles no longer fire during damage intake. Instead, they launch upward on death and redirect to Gatekeepers.Significantly reduced healing of Sirens by Exalted elites.Siren shields (from events or elite status) are now visible on the main HP bar.Hovering a locked ban slot in the Emporium now shows your artifact progress toward unlocking it.Burning and bleeding no longer interrupt player sprint.Added option to enable a dark background under the crosshair with adjustable transparency.Small enemies can now be pushed aside to avoid body-blocking.You can now view current run stats on Delta and Arena locations without ending the run.Resurrection count (how many times you've revived teammates) is now shown in the run stats.Any HP penalties (e.g. from Empty Carapace) are now shown directly on the HP bar.Dash mode can now be toggled between movement direction and cursor direction.Lobby code is now hidden by default (streamer-friendly).Minimap readability improved.Option to enable auto-sprint has been added to the settings.Healing numbers now appear when a Gatekeeper is healed by anything other than natural regeneration (can be disabled in settings).Improved visibility of the Fractal activation effect.Aeonic EliteAeonic elite effect changed: instead of freezing cooldowns, they now slow them by 50%.UIAlmost all interactive UI elements have been reworked.UI is now less visually cluttered and gamepad navigation is much clearer.Most in-game text has been enlarged for better readability.Difficulty80% difficulty has been removed.Other difficulties have been rebalanced so that 100% feels comfortable for new players, and 200% provides sufficient challenge for veterans.DatabaseNow displays:Kills per specific enemyArtifact pickup countsCrafted triadsRuns per GatekeeperDelta RedesignComplete redesign of Quiet Bay.The location was reduced by ~30%, and diagonal paths were rebuilt for easier navigation.Lighting has been improved for better visual clarity.Bug Fixes & Stability ImprovementsAstral Elite attacks on Drudge spawned flickers that exploded on the Gatekeeper.Totem charging could fail after death and reconnection.Fixed some abuse cases of Arcanum’s Bounty artifact.Fixed a case where the Forge or Obelisk UI could become unclosable if a full artifact category was banned in the Emporium.Onslaught marker jittered heavily near moving enemies for teammates.Fixed various issues after reconnecting to a run.Drudge count could be incorrect after melting Halfmetal Head in the Forge.Drudges no longer respawn if their owner is dead.Some achievements no longer trigger for dead Gatekeepers when completed by teammates.Major rework of projectile handling for Gatekeepers and enemies over the network to reduce lag and improve stability.Ground artifact pickup popup no longer fails to close.Enemies frequently getting stuck on environmental corners has been fixed.Significant work has been done in collaboration with the developer of the networking plugin we use.
