> Greetings, Gatekeepers!We’re kicking off a brand new devblog series about the upcoming update for Gatekeeper,
> titled “The Nowhere Throne” — aka version 1.0.There’s a lot to talk about (and we do mean a lot), but as tradition demands, we’re starting with what matters most — the new Gatekeeper.AegisAegis commanded the Order of the Delta Guardians — a force that covered the retreat of allied troops. On the day the Void Empire broke through the defenses, Lord Crustad cast him into a crystal well — the heart of an arcana mine.Arcana did not let the body disappear. Shards grew through his armor, preserved the flesh, and dragged his mind into the Nowhere. There, the Creators offered him a place among the Gatekeepers. He accepted.AbilitiesSplinterFires a crystal shard from one hand that pierces up to 3 enemies.Evo 1: Each enemy pierced increases the shard's damage.Evo 2: The shard explodes on destruction, dealing AoE damage.Evo 3: Two extra shards spawn at the first hit location.A simple but brutally effective skill — especially against groups. Deploy GlyphonPlaces a stationary Glyphon at a targeted location.
> Only one can be active at a time — placing a new one replaces the old.Evo 1: Max active Glyphons +1Evo 2: Max active Glyphons +1Evo 3: Glyphons gain access to Aegis’s artifacts.Yes — Aegis can summon up to three Glyphons, and each one can use your artifacts. How cool is that? SpectraLeaves behind a Spectra and enters a phase state.
> The state ends if you take any action other than movement, or when the timer runs out.
> The Spectra vanishes once Aegis reappears.Evo 1: Creates a pulling pulse at the activation point.Evo 2: Explodes when the Spectra is destroyed.Evo 3: Creates a weakening cloud on death.Low on HP? Drop a decoy, phase through enemies, and flank from the side.
> Profit. AscensionActivates Ascension for Aegis and all active Glyphons.While Ascended, Aegis fires from both hands with enhanced Splinters.
> Consumes all available charges — increasing fire rate and shard size, but slowing Aegis down.Evo 1: Kills replenish the Ascension meter.Evo 2: Shards pierce unlimited enemies.Evo 3: Each hand fires two shards at once.This is, without exaggeration, our most over-the-top ability yet.
> Press one button — turn the battlefield into a crater.Link Field (Passive)Nice and simple — while Aegis stands near a Glyphon, it absorbs part of the damage he takes.I’ve played a lot with Aegis, and as of now — he’s my favorite Gatekeeper. His kit feels really fresh for Gatekeeper, and I think many of you will love the playstyle.Charging into a horde with 4 Ascension charges active, Glyphons blasting, shards flying —
> yeah, it’s definitely a “wow” moment. That’s all for today — but the next devblog is already cooking.
> We’ll be diving into tons of QoL improvements and balance changes, so if brutal tweaks and spicy balance changes are your thing… stay tuned.Next post drops in two weeks.Until then...See you in the Throne Room— Gravity Lagoon SocialsJoin our DiscordJoin our SubredditFollow on X
