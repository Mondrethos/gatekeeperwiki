# Three Days till Launch

<p class="bb_paragraph">Hey Gatekeepers,</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The wait is almost over — Gatekeeper launches in just 3 days, on August 1st!</p><p class="bb_paragraph">To celebrate, we’re kicking off a short series of posts highlighting some of the playable characters you’ll get to command on your mission to reclaim the Heart of Time.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Let’s start with one of the most striking Gatekeepers in the lineup: </p><div class="bb_h2"><b>Aegis</b> </div><p class="bb_paragraph">Once the leader of the Delta Guardians, Aegis fell in battle during the Void Empire’s final push — only to be reborn through arcana-infused crystal deep in the mines of Nowhere. Now, he fights with the power of the Creators, armored in glass and vengeance.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/42755050/410e119e2f0ee47759c4c2b84ee9e860c905888b.png" /></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Aegis is a mid-range specialist with piercing crystal projectiles, a teleport-like phasing ability, and the unique power to deploy Glyphons — arcane constructs that help him dominate the battlefield. When upgraded, Aegis becomes a force of nature: launching massive volleys of splinters, unleashing battlefield-wide damage bursts, and linking up with his Glyphons in devastating synergy.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/42755050/d18ff46a48432f4428e93beb4228d0c3a3a32e1a.png" /></p><p class="bb_paragraph">He’s a slow-burning powerhouse — but when he activates his ultimate, Ascension, things go full chaos.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Keep an eye out for more character spotlights in the coming days.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Don’t forget to join the fight when Gatekeeper launches on August 1st!</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Thank you,</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b><i>Gravity Lagoon</i></b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2">Socials</div><p class="bb_paragraph"><a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2Fgravitylagoon" rel=" noopener" target="_blank">Join our Discord</a></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><a class="bb_link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gatekeeper/" rel="" target="_blank">Join our Subreddit</a></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2Fgatekeeper_game" rel=" noopener" target="_blank">Follow on X</a></p>
