> Greetings, Gatekeepers!Today we’re bringing you two big updates: a brand-new trailer, and — deep breath — the official release date!
>
> The 1.0 version is packed with new content — and we’ll be sharing the details step by step over the next couple of months. So make sure to follow us on Steam so you don’t miss anything ;)
>
> A bit more about Aegis
> Aegis is a heavy-hitting ranged Gatekeeper with slow but powerful shots that pierce multiple enemies. He can deploy arcane turrets that copy his damage, shift into a ghostly form to avoid danger, and enter an enhanced state to unleash rapid dual attacks. Perfect for players who like methodical control, high burst damage, and battlefield dominance.
>
> We’ll cover his abilities in more detail in a dedicated dev blog.
>
> We’re also happy to announce that the Steam page has been updated!
>
> We’ve refreshed the main header image, added new screenshots, and replaced the old descriptions with updated text and GIFs.
>
> We hope you enjoyed the trailer and are just as hyped for 1.0 as we are :)
> (We may or may not have rewatched it a hundred times already)
>
> Stay tuned — we’ll be announcing beta testing for the release version very soon.
> If you want early access, don’t miss it!
