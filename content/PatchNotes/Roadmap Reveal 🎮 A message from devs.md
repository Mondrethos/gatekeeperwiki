Greetings, Gatekeepers!  
  

Gatekeeper will launch in Early Access.

  
Yes, we realize that this decision may have its flaws, but we believe it is the right one. Please keep in mind that we are a tiny studio of 4 people: we genuinely want to bring the game to a perfect state, and without a constant flow of feedback from a lot of players this is nearly impossible under our circumstances.  
  
Gatekeeper will be in Early Access for about a year, and during this year we'll be polishing the game, tweaking the balance and adding new content based on your reports. After all, that's what Early Access was originally designed for, not as an excuse for raw and buggy releases (which we hope is not our case at all). It will be a long but interesting journey, so let's make the most of it together!  
  

Roadmap Reveal

  
In the initial days or weeks following the release, we'll focus on patching the game and fine-tuning the balance. After that, we'll dive straight into creating new content. We're eager to roll out the first major update on Steam as soon as possible!

Thank you,  
Gravity Lagoon
