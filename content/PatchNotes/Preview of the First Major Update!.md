# Preview of the First Major Update!

<div class="bb_h3">Greetings, Gatekeepers! </div><br /><div class="bb_h2">We don’t know if you missed some of development updates, but we definitely missed delivering those to you! <br />After a great start of early access, we continue working and nourishing the game, currently preparing the first major update, which is supposed to go live in Q3 2024. <br /><br />Don't miss your chance to grab the game with a discount!</div><br /><div class="bb_h3">As usual we work on new features and also your feedback, that gave us plenty of food for thought. Take a look of what’s on our table right now.</div><br /><div class="bb_h1">Delta</div><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/42755050/3a3dd1560ff20431429af04c475fb5d242d2a282.png" /><br /><div class="bb_h3">After each planet, Gatekeepers will appear on Delta, the only place in the Universe where its guardians may catch their breath. Apart from being a safe and peaceful harbour, Delta is also known for having the biggest market, where artisans, engineers, mages and merchants trade their goods. Gatekeepers are also allowed to buy things, if they have coins of course…</div><br /><div class="bb_h1">Bigger maps</div><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/42755050/f541118e618dceea6bc2d588f7b010386ccc1300.png" /><br /><div class="bb_h3">After careful consideration, rounds of debates and an almost unanimous Discord voting, we decided to make locations a lot bigger. The idea is to give more space to explore and make the overall game flow smoother by reducing loading screens time and removing the rule of 3 locations per planet. And we definitely can’t make such a change without adding a minimap.</div><br /><div class="bb_h1">Balance</div><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/42755050/63453cd1fdecde3024bf5dc09199045762a37de9.png" /><br /><div class="bb_h3">Actually, it is a neverending process for the game, but still had to be mentioned here as at least one big change is planned and it’s a logarithmic growth for some items. It will help us to remove the hard cap for items with limited stacking (like Rune of Rebound with its dodge chance). </div><br /><div class="bb_h1">Upgrades on items</div><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/42755050/bfcb262a83e6a14efd83b75f8091f1bfbf53863e.png" /><br /><div class="bb_h3">This one is more vague and conceptional, but as one of the main objectives of this release is to make the gameplay deeper and give you more decisions to make, we consider several options for the items system upgrades. Those are not fully shaped in our heads yet, so to not give you false expectations, will keep you posted when we have more details to share.</div><br /><div class="bb_h1">Buy Gatekeeper now with 20% OFF during this Summer Sale!</div><br /><a class="bb_link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2106670/Gatekeeper/" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2106670/Gatekeeper/</a><br /><br /><div class="bb_h3">Thank you,<br />Gravity Lagoon<br /><br />Useful links:</div><br /><a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FHkrp6AUa5S" rel=" noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/42755050/d0a560fa78423e2e3e18c3294e8b4553dac70eb9.png" /></a>
