> Hey Gatekeepers,Only 2 days left until Gatekeeper launches on August 1st!We’re continuing our countdown with another character spotlight — this time, featuring Void Model:Void ModelDesigned for those who thrive in the chaos of battle, Void Model is our most agile and volatile Gatekeeper yet. Her playstyle revolves around aggressive dashes, rapid strikes, and skillful control of Entropy — a resource she builds and consumes to amplify her power.Void Model excels at weaving through enemy lines, gaining Entropy with every hit, then unleashing devastating ranged bursts that restore her health and apply lingering effects. Her incorporeal form lets her tear through foes in an area while cleansing herself of debuffs, and her claws can leave enemies bleeding when Entropy reaches its peak.With proper timing and positioning, Void Model becomes a deadly force — dashing, detonating, and draining the battlefield with surgical precision.If you're a fan of fast-paced AoE combat, blink-and-you-miss-it movement, and brutal synergy scaling — Void Model is your favorite.Stay tuned — more character highlights are coming soon.Don't forget to join the fight when Gatekeeper releases on August 1st!Thank you,Gravity LagoonSocialsJoin our DiscordJoin our SubredditFollow on X
